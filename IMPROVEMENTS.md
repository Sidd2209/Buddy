GET /status
```
Returns:
- Queue status and length
- Server statistics
- Room statistics
- Performance configuration

### 2. **Real-time Monitoring**
- Connection quality indicators
- RTT monitoring
- Packet loss detection
- User activity tracking

## ðŸ”„ Connection Flow

### 1. **User Joins**
1. User connects to server
2. Added to queue immediately
3. Queue processing starts
4. Paired with next available user

### 2. **Room Creation**
1. Two users selected from queue
2. Room created with unique ID
3. WebRTC signaling initiated
4. Connection established

### 3. **Next/Disconnect**
1. Room torn down immediately
2. Both users returned to queue
3. New pairing process starts
4. Fast reconnection

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python app.py

# Frontend
npm run dev
```

### Key Features
